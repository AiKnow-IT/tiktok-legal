      <h2>Our Safety Philosophy</h2>
      <p>At AIKnow-IT, child safety isn't a feature — it's the foundation of everything we build. Every component of our platform, from AI prompts to publishing workflows, is designed with the safety of young viewers as the top priority. We believe that creators should be able to produce engaging, educational, and entertaining content for children without ever having to worry about inappropriate material slipping through.</p>

      <h2>Content Generation Guardrails</h2>
      <p>Our AI content generation system operates under strict guidelines that are enforced at every stage of the pipeline:</p>

      <h3>What we always include</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Original characters:</strong> Every video features unique, original characters created by the AI. We never use or reference copyrighted characters from existing media.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive themes:</strong> Content revolves around friendship, adventure, curiosity, humor, and learning — themes that inspire and entertain without causing harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Age-appropriate language:</strong> All dialogue, captions, and hashtags are crafted to be suitable for audiences aged 8–12.</li>
        <li><strong>Bright, vibrant visuals:</strong> Videos use colorful, cartoon-style animation that is visually appealing and non-threatening to young viewers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What we never include</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Violence or gore:</strong> No depictions of violence, fighting, weapons, or physical harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Adult content:</strong> No sexual, suggestive, or romantic content of any kind.</li>
        <li><strong>Hate or harassment:</strong> No bullying, discrimination, hate speech, or harassment.</li>
        <li><strong>Real people:</strong> No depictions of real individuals, public figures, or celebrities.</li>
        <li><strong>Copyrighted material:</strong> No characters, music, or other IP from existing franchises.</li>
        <li><strong>Frightening content:</strong> No horror, jump scares, or content designed to frighten.</li>
        <li><strong>Dangerous activities:</strong> No depictions of activities that could encourage unsafe behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Multi-Layer Safety System</h2>

      <h3>Layer 1: Prompt Engineering</h3>
      <p>Our AI generation prompts contain explicit, detailed safety instructions that prevent the model from generating inappropriate content. These prompts are carefully engineered and regularly reviewed to close any potential gaps.</p>

      <h3>Layer 2: Output Validation</h3>
      <p>Every generated script is programmatically validated to ensure it meets our content standards. This includes checking for required fields, appropriate themes, and the absence of prohibited content markers.</p>

      <h3>Layer 3: Pre-Publish Review</h3>
      <p>Before any content is published to social media platforms, users have the opportunity to review the generated video, caption, and hashtags. This human-in-the-loop step ensures that the final published content meets the creator's standards.</p>

      <h3>Layer 4: Platform Compliance</h3>
      <p>All published content is designed to comply with the community guidelines and content policies of TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Videos are tagged with appropriate age and content designations on each platform.</p>

      <h2>Reporting Concerns</h2>
      <p>If you encounter any content generated through AIKnow-IT that you believe is inappropriate or unsafe, please report it immediately to <a href="mailto:business.ai.gpt@gmail.com">business.ai.gpt@gmail.com</a>. We take every report seriously and will investigate and take action within 24 hours.</p>

      <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
      <p>We continuously review and improve our safety systems based on new developments in AI safety, feedback from users and parents, and updates to platform community guidelines. Our commitment to child safety is ongoing and evolving.</p>
